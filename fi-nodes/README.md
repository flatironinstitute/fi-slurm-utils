The fi-nodes directory contains the code for the fi-nodes command-line utility, which provides reports on the state of the cluster in detailed form (building on the ~carriero/bin/featureInfo utility), in abbreviated tree form, and provides historical cluster data via Prometheus through a terminal user interface (TUI).
